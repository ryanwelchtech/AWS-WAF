# AWS-WAF
I am going to be creating an EC2 instance running WordPress. I’ll put an Application Load Balancer in front of it, and then associate an AWS WAF WebACL with that load balancer.

I’ll then explore the different rules and actions I can configure, as well as setting up WAF logging to S3 and viewing those logs.

I will be creating this environment in the us-east-1 (N. Virginia) region.
